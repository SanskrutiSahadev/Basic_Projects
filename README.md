## 🚀 Features
- Clean and simple user interface  
- Handles user input through Flask  
- Dynamic output on a separate results page  
- External CSS styling  
- Beginner-friendly code structure  

---

## 📦 Requirements
Install Flask before running:

```bash
pip install flask
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run the App
Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open this URL in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🧠
How It Works
1. User enters **name, age, and hobby** in the form.  
2. Flask receives the submitted form data.  
3. `generate_output()` builds a customized introduction message.  
4. The result is displayed on `result.html`.

## 🎨 Adding a Background Image
Place your image in the **static** folder (example: `bg.jpg`).

Add this to `style.css`:

```css
body {
    background-image: url("/static/bg.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
